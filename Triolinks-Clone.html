    <p>Can I leanly test it and quickly find out if it's viable?</p>
    <p>What problems can I solve that my competition cannot?</p>
    <p>What's the opportunity cost?</p>
    <p>How can I measure success‚Äîand failure?</p>
    <p>.....</p>
    <p> Ugh!!!! and list goes on disrupting your neocortex and limbic cells!</p>

            <div class="hiddendiv">An MVP, or minimum viable product, is a stripped-down version of a potential market product that is designed to test the feasibility of the concept and gauge customer demand. It allows companies to test the waters and gather valuable feedback before fully committing to a product launch, saving time and resources. An MVP typically only includes the core features and highlights the unique selling points of the product, with the intention of expanding and improving upon the MVP in future releases.</div>

            <div class="clicker" tabindex="1"><h5>Why is MVP important?</h5></div>
            <div class="hiddendiv">An MVP allows startups to solve cash flow issues by releasing a product earlier and without overspending on development. It helps generate revenue from early customers, which can be used for market research, adding desired features, and marketing to a wider audience. MVP development also helps build a user base and establish a market for future products. It is easier to sell to existing customers than to find new ones.</div>
